# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The project follows Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- Make the language of the current user message authoritative so persistent memory, profile preferences, locale, and prior chats cannot silently switch the response language.
- Treat a default “Try in chat” invocation without product context as empty intake: ask briefly for the product brief instead of inventing a stage, reusing remembered project details, or exposing installation and skill-loading internals.
- Prevent automatically supplied memory from acting as missing product context or triggering an unrequested durable memory update.

### Changed

- Shorten the Codex default prompt and encode the language, memory, and empty-intake safeguards directly in it.
- Add a clean Codex Skill Installer subdirectory that excludes maintainer tests, evaluation catalogs, release tooling, and nested distribution packages.
- Add regression cases and deterministic package checks for cross-language memory contamination, empty starter behavior, diagnostic-claim restraint, and clean Codex installation.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-14

### Security

- Replace test-only dynamic module execution with a normal import so repository scanners no longer classify the evaluation regression test as runtime dynamic-code execution.
- Replace invisible HTML provenance comments in generated Workspace Kit files with visible Markdown source markers while preserving embedded-reference traceability.
- Preserve standard Persian zero-width non-joiners; scanner heuristics may report these legitimate orthographic characters as low-confidence hidden-instruction findings.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- Replace question-count pacing with outcome-based sufficiency: once current evidence supports a responsible baseline, produce one coherent useful pass and ask again only for a newly reached consequential choice with no safe default.
- Keep internal status and control vocabulary out of ordinary conversation while retaining exact evidence states and IA Reference Locks in requested team or machine handoffs.
- Separate product recommendations from commitments so authentication, persistence, synchronization, monetization, promotion, engagement mechanics, and growth metrics are not silently added.
- Strengthen portable Workspace Kit instructions so file-only and instruction-plus-knowledge environments preserve the same pacing, plain-language, memory-isolation, and product-scope behavior.
- Make product-sitemap abstraction explicit by separating destinations from views, states, capabilities, controls, and semantic domains; extend the companion schema and validator accordingly.
- Strengthen user-flow integrity with attributed actions, labeled and distinct decision branches, consequence-proportional failure coverage, and rendered branch-legibility checks.
- Expand behavioral QA for jargon leakage, bilingual duplication, product-growth drift, sitemap abstraction mixing, and diagram overlap or ambiguous connectors.
- Add stage-complete closure: summarize confirmed choices, reversible assumptions, open risks, and current scope before offering only relevant optional continuations.
- Make continuation portable by default and prohibit proactive prior-chat memory retrieval or durable context mutation without a current explicit request and evidenced capability.
- Preserve explicit product direction, separate accounts from role-scoped profiles or workspaces, and add minimum trust/safety prompts for open multi-party systems.
- Clarify detailed sitemap completeness, access gates versus hierarchy, role workspaces, pre- versus post-transaction destinations, and external-payment return/recovery states.
- Upgrade behavioral evaluation from atomic prompt checks alone to a versioned two-layer contract with reproducible multi-turn journeys, observable per-turn signals, critical failures, unmeasured layers, and cross-package semantic parity.
- Add a deterministic evaluation-catalog validator and isolated QA dependency so malformed or shallow release evidence cannot pass merely because case IDs exist.
- Promote package metadata and documentation to the 1.0.0 stable contract while retaining evidence limits for cross-host behavior and external security scans.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Refactor the native Skill entrypoint into a smaller decision kernel with conditional reference routing, reducing default instruction load while preserving end-to-end IA depth.
- Calibrate engagement intent and depth before questioning; give idea-stage users useful orientation and treat “I don't know” as a mentoring signal for one reversible Proposed default instead of serial interrogation.
- Clarify decision-scoped pauses: complete safe independent analysis, defer only the affected branch, then ask the smallest consequential question.
- Reframe IA as the canonical source for explicitly requested downstream UI, image, prototype, sitemap, user-flow, document, presentation, builder, and technical outputs.
- Add the IA Reference Lock and Suite Handoff Manifest so downstream adaptations remain traceable to approved structure, labels, findability, access/privacy, evidence, and unresolved assumptions.
- Add a capability-evidence ladder with portable handoff fallback when production capability is unknown.
- Redesign the Workspace Kit opening as a high-priority operating core plus module index for file-knowledge hosts, while preserving one-file setup.
- Preserve the official `ProPaymun` spelling in multilingual behavior and remove internal control jargon from ordinary user-facing progress.
- Extend the builder exporter with a machine-readable IA Reference Lock protected by the existing source-data boundary.
- Expand behavioral evaluation for idea-stage novices, repeated uncertainty, downstream UI composition, unknown host capability, brand spelling, jargon leakage, and derivative drift.
- Add repository line-ending policy so generated package parity is stable across Windows and Unix checkouts.
- Add first-class, selectively loaded product-sitemap and stateful user-flow companion workflows without forcing complete IA discovery for focused requests.
- Add versioned minimum semantic substrates for standalone companion work while preserving IA Reference Lock behavior when accepted IA exists.
- Distinguish product/UX sitemaps from XML/SEO sitemap intent and add destination, branch, failure, recovery, permission, and success integrity rules.
- Add dependency-free companion JSON schemas, structural validation, and valid/invalid fixtures for product sitemaps and user flows.
- Strengthen pacing after foundational decisions and after “I don't know,” and prohibit unrequested Memory, Project Knowledge, Gem Knowledge, or workspace-context mutation.
- Treat business-model and operating choices as IA inputs only when they change identities, transactions, visibility, ownership, access, lifecycle, or findability.
- Replace role-rank marketing language with observable product-decision behavior across native and portable packages.
- Expand the portable Workspace Kit activation contract so IA, product sitemaps, and user flows work in instruction-plus-knowledge and file-only environments without naming unverified hosts as supported.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-07

- Add single-Markdown setup guidance for file-based Projects/Gems, with native Claude ZIP use distinguished explicitly.
- Reinforce experienced product guidance, evidence-based scope, independent taxonomy facets, optional relationships, and text/diagram reconciliation.

- Harden builder exports with explicit source-data boundaries, collision-resistant Markdown fences, encoded context, and bounded prompt size while preserving canonical JSON and both handoff intents.
- Preserve input and existing output files during builder export and HTML rendering; callers must choose fresh output paths.
- Remove maintainer package-building code from installable ZIPs; retain the three optional runtime helpers.
- Narrow discovery triggers and disclose optional Python capabilities without pre-authorizing broad tools.
- Add adversarial export regression tests and source-injection behavioral evaluation cases. External rescanning and host behavioral tests remain pending.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-05

### Changed

- Reframed the skill as a product-lead IA mentor that carries the method for non-specialists and explains product consequences instead of dumping specialist structure.
- Added current-turn authority and memory isolation: persistent preferences may adjust harmless presentation choices but cannot authorize artifacts, establish domain evidence, or convert discovery into delivery.
- Added token discipline through selective source loading, compact question groups, progressive disclosure, delta updates, and one representation at a time.
- Replaced the universal hard stop with a decision-scoped sufficiency gate: a blocking unknown pauses only the affected consequential decision while independent reversible analysis may continue.
- Added problem-shape recognition for content/taxonomy, object/operation, and hybrid IA so content-led products are not forced into an object-heavy model.
- Added priority information-need traces from audience and entry point through labels, canonical information, access, and recovery.
- Added a change-impact workflow that preserves stable IDs, updates the canonical model once, checks dependent layers, reports a compact delta, and revalidates before export.
- Split Visual Builder Handoff into explicit `ia-blueprint` and `product-prototype` intents while preserving one Markdown specification plus one short launch instruction.
- Strengthened Semantic IA validation for empty models, item kinds, handoff purposes, permission scopes/actions, information needs, and provisional handoffs with blocking unknowns.
- Expanded the HTML renderer with information needs, roles/access, lifecycles, navigation/search, decisions, localized headings, and readable structured values.
- Added behavioral cases and deterministic regression tests for memory conflict, token discipline, content-led IA, handoff intent, change impact, invalid semantic models, prototype exports, and relationship direction.
- Aligned repository and package licensing with MIT No Attribution (`MIT-0`).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- Corrected host-support language: Gemini web is documented as a manually created Gem; unverified CLI commands and unverified claims for file-capable hosts are removed.
- Removed Kimi and Z.AI from the list of certified installation or persistent-workspace surfaces; file attachment remains a truthful one-off fallback when a host supports it.
- Added a regression test that rejects future claims for removed hosts or unverified Gemini CLI installation.
- Replaced model-branded distribution names with two professional packages: **Agent Skill Package** for native Skill upload and **Workspace Kit** for Projects, Gems, custom agents, and file-capable chats.
- Added an adaptive sufficiency loop that repeats whenever the work reaches a consequential new layer, an assumption changes, or an export is requested.
- Added contextual localization that separates language, locale, jurisdiction, culture, and operating model instead of inferring local roles or rules from language alone.
- Upgraded the canonical machine-readable contract to Semantic IA 2.0 with information domains, a single item registry, typed relationships, roles, permissions, lifecycle transitions, blocking unknowns, and handoff readiness.
- Reclassified Figma Make and Lovable as optional downstream **Visual Builder Handoff** targets generated only after the IA is ready.
- Added a deterministic builder exporter that produces both a self-contained Markdown specification and a short launch instruction for builder input fields.
- Required builder outputs to lead with a readable, connected domain-to-item architecture and explicitly exclude product UI, dashboards, sitemaps, user flows, APIs, and database schemas.
- Added deterministic package generation, a machine-scannable package manifest, canonical package paths, and synchronized legacy download aliases.
- Rewrote English and Persian repository guidance for human comprehension and reliable AI-assisted installation.
- Expanded behavioral and script coverage for midstream clarification, localization, Semantic IA integrity, package parity, export readiness, and downstream builder handoff.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- Added a shared autonomous sufficiency gate: material unknowns trigger a questions-only response and a hard stop without requiring prompting instructions from the user.
- Replaced fixed, jargon-heavy checkpoints with product-language decisions and consequence-aware assumptions for novice users.
- Clarified IA as the canonical semantic foundation while keeping sitemap and user-flow production in dedicated skills.
- Added environment-aware delivery shared by the canonical skill: conversation-first agents default to concise chat, while build-first environments use their native output medium.
- Reworked the Figma Make profile to build an architecture-first IA Structure Explorer after discovery instead of returning only text or building the product UI.
- Made Plan mode optional rather than a prerequisite for correct Figma behavior.
- Expanded capability-aware public research, private-data boundaries, source citation, and unavailable-tool fallbacks.
- Added a cross-platform adapter manifest and deterministic parity checks so the canonical skill, Figma adapter, metadata, and documentation release together.
- Added behavioral cases for empty Figma intake, sufficient Figma briefs, minimal novice answers, autonomous stopping, and source-aware public research.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- Restricted the skill to information architecture only; neighboring mapping deliverables are intentionally excluded.
- Made guided, question-first behavior the default for complete, complex, multi-role, sensitive, and consequential IA work.
- Limited quick provisional work to explicit speed or no-question requests and reduced its default depth.
- Replaced the default Markdown-and-Mermaid artifact with concise, decision-ready chat output.
- Required user acceptance before creating files, diagrams, images, or machine-readable models.
- Added audience-aware, human-first language guidance and pragmatic English technical labels for unreliable RTL renderers.
- Added capability detection, chat-only fallbacks, browsing/source rules, and privacy boundaries.
- Made IA diagrams optional and Draw.io/Excalidraw optional companions that require explicit installation authorization.
- Reworked deliverable guidance around layered, audience-specific communication instead of a fixed complete-report template.
- Expanded behavioral evaluation for natural Persian intake, medical-data risk, artifact consent, chat-only environments, and RTL diagrams.
- Made Figma adapter generation line-ending-stable across operating systems.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Guided, Quick Draft, and Focused Artifact modes.
- Evidence-aware IA workflow with five optional human checkpoints.
- Object-first modeling, taxonomy, labeling, navigation, search, permissions, validation, and governance references.
- Portable semantic IA JSON schema and structural validator.
- Standalone accessible HTML renderer with RTL support.
- Mermaid-first diagram routing with Draw.io and Excalidraw guidance.
- Single-file Figma agent/Figma Make adapter.
- English and Persian documentation.
- Three behavioral evaluation scenarios and deterministic script tests.
