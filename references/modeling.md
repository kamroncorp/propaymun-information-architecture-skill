# Modeling and option generation

Read this reference when creating object models, taxonomies, labeling systems, navigation/search structures, or architecture alternatives.

## Semantic model sequence

Model in this order when relevant:

1. users, roles, contexts, and priority tasks;
2. domain objects and content types;
3. attributes, metadata, and relationships;
4. actions, states, lifecycle, and permissions;
5. organization schemes and taxonomy;
6. labels and vocabulary;
7. navigation, search, entry, and recovery;
8. governance and validation.

This is a reasoning order, not a mandatory conversation order.

## Model the information universe

First recognize the dominant IA problem:

- **content/taxonomy:** content types, topics, audience vocabulary, metadata, classification, browse, and search carry most of the architecture;
- **object/operation:** persistent objects, records, relationships, states, ownership, permissions, and lifecycle carry most of the architecture;
- **hybrid:** both are consequential and must meet in one model.

This is an internal modeling choice, not a mode the user must select. Do not force roles, permissions, lifecycle, or object-style detail into a content-led problem unless it improves a real decision.

Before choosing a visual or document structure, distinguish:

- **information domain:** a stable subject or responsibility area;
- **concept or object:** a recognizable thing people reason about or act on;
- **content type or record:** a governed information structure with attributes and lifecycle;
- **classification:** a way of grouping or faceting items;
- **destination or page:** a later interface exposure that belongs in a sitemap, not the canonical IA hierarchy;
- **task step:** an action or state transition that belongs in a user flow.

Use one canonical item registry. Every item must reference exactly one information domain; do not maintain separate `objects` and `nodes` lists that can drift. Build a parent-child hierarchy only where containment, scope, or classification is real. Add typed relationships for association, dependency, reference, membership, ownership, lifecycle, visibility, or derivation. Name the relationship in product language so a non-specialist can understand its consequence.

Exactly one `domain_id` means one canonical home in the model. It does not prevent facets, tags, related-content links, contextual exposure, search results, or alternate findability paths.

Model a relationship record such as membership, assignment, payment, or application as its own item when it has attributes, lifecycle, permissions, history, or findability. Do not collapse distinct objects only to make a diagram smaller.

For an existing product, derive the candidate model from the content inventory, current structure, search/navigation evidence, policies, and observed failures. For a new product, derive it from audiences, priority tasks, planned capabilities, domain rules, and information that must be created, found, understood, governed, or retained.

## Canonical item card

For each important object capture:

```yaml
id: item-project
domain_id: domain-work
name: Project
kind: object
purpose: Unit of coordinated work
parent_id: null
attributes: [name, owner, status, due_date]
relationships:
  - target: Workspace
    type: belongs_to
actions: [create, view, edit, archive]
states: [draft, active, completed, archived]
roles: [owner, editor, viewer]
entry_points: [global_search, workspace_projects, recent_items]
lifecycle_owner: Product Operations
evidence_status: Proposed
```

## Relationship and lifecycle integrity

- Use `parent_id` only for a real primary hierarchy.
- Use typed relationships for additional meaning, including `belongs_to`, `references`, `membership`, `assignment`, `settles`, `owned_by`, and `visible_to`.
- Give each relationship explicit endpoints, direction, label, meaning, and evidence state.
- When an item can belong to alternative scopes, model the options explicitly instead of forcing one parent.
- Structure lifecycle states and transitions. For each transition record the source, destination, permitted role, condition, and evidence state when relevant.
- Keep roles distinct until their permissions and authority are confirmed equivalent.

## Taxonomy design

Define:

- purpose and audiences;
- meta-characteristic or governing classification intent;
- dimensions and category membership rules;
- polyhierarchy or faceting policy;
- synonym, preferred term, and localization policy;
- inclusion/exclusion examples;
- objective and subjective stopping conditions;
- owner and extension/deprecation rules.

Useful subjective qualities: concise, robust, comprehensive within scope, extendible, and explanatory. Do not force mutual exclusivity when the product genuinely needs facets, tags, or multiple classification.

## Generate meaningful alternatives

Alternatives must differ structurally, not just in labels or colors. Typical lenses:

- task-first;
- object/resource-first;
- audience/role-first;
- lifecycle/state-first;
- topic/domain-first;
- hybrid with stable primary structure plus facets or contextual paths.

For each option state:

- organizing principle;
- tasks it supports well;
- likely failure modes;
- dependence on search or personalization;
- scalability and governance cost;
- evidence supporting it;
- validation needed.

Recommend one only after comparing it with priority tasks and constraints.

## Navigation model

Specify each navigation system's purpose, audience, content scope, ordering rule, visibility rule, and relationship to search. Avoid one overloaded global menu for unrelated tasks.

## Search model

Specify searchable objects/content, metadata and facets, synonyms, ranking signals, permission filtering, result types, empty-state behavior, and recovery. Never expose restricted content through labels, counts, snippets, or suggestions.

## Priority information-need trace

For each priority need, verify this chain without turning it into a screen-by-screen flow:

`audience/context → information sought → entry point → organizing cue or label → canonical item/content → access rule → recovery`

Use the trace to catch orphaned content, misleading labels, missing entry points, inaccessible search results, and dead ends. Keep only traces that test consequential parts of the architecture.

## AI product considerations

For products containing agents or generated content, also model:

- user, system, tool, source, conversation, run, artifact, memory, and permission objects;
- provenance and citation at the claim or artifact level;
- draft/review/approved states;
- human confirmation for consequential actions;
- visibility and retention boundaries;
- stable canonical locations despite adaptive recommendations;
- recovery, undo, retry, and escalation.

## Revising an existing architecture

Treat a correction or new requirement as a change to the canonical model, not as a fresh parallel document.

1. classify the input as a new fact, decision, scope change, label change, evidence update, or implementation constraint;
2. identify the directly affected IDs and then inspect dependent hierarchy, relationships, information-need traces, navigation, search, access, lifecycle, governance, validation, and renderer views;
3. preserve stable IDs unless the underlying meaning changed; record merges, splits, renames, and deprecations explicitly;
4. update the canonical model once and regenerate derived views instead of hand-editing each output;
5. show the user a compact delta, its product consequences, any newly blocking unknown, and the next validation need;
6. rerun structural validation and handoff-readiness checks before export.

Do not repeat the full architecture when only a small part changed unless the user requests a consolidated artifact.
